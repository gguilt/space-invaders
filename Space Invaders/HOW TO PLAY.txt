Arrow keys: Moving your player.
Space key: Firing laser shoot.
B key: Firing 105mm bullet. (More effective than laser in game universe)
P key: Pause the game.
ESC: Quit from game. (Only if game is over or paused)

Every level up, you got new health and a new 105mm ammo. Your laser only shoot when
	previous shoot touched anything. (Invaders or screen.)

Scoreboard has a problem, not saving your name after you enter your name. So scoreboard only
	shows you the scores, not who get this. Sorry about that.

I'm not planning publishing this game. If you get this game, i hope you're enjoy.
